## Software Building Documents

In software development, various types of documents are created to ensure clarity, effective communication, and alignment between stakeholders, development teams, and other contributors. Below is an overview of commonly used documents, including the **Functional Requirements Document (FRD)** and others:

---

### **1. Functional Requirements Document (FRD)**

- **Purpose**: Describes the functional requirements of the system, detailing what the system should do.
- **Audience**: Business analysts, stakeholders, and development teams.
- **Key Components**:
  - System functionality (features and use cases)
  - User stories or scenarios
  - Diagrams (e.g., flowcharts or user interaction models)
  - Input/output requirements

---

### **2. Business Requirements Document (BRD)**

- **Purpose**: Captures high-level business goals and objectives.
- **Audience**: Stakeholders, project managers, and analysts.
- **Key Components**:
  - Project scope
  - Business objectives and needs
  - Key stakeholders
  - High-level functional and non-functional requirements

---

### **3. Technical Requirements Document (TRD)**

- **Purpose**: Details the technical specifications and architecture required to implement the functional requirements.
- **Audience**: Developers, system architects, and DevOps teams.
- **Key Components**:
  - System architecture and design
  - Database schema
  - Technology stack
  - Integration points and APIs

---

### **4. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive document covering all functional, non-functional, and technical requirements.
- **Audience**: Cross-functional teams (developers, testers, project managers, stakeholders).
- **Key Components**:
  - Functional requirements (from FRD)
  - Non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, scalability, security)
  - Use cases and system diagrams
  - Constraints and assumptions

---

### **5. Non-Functional Requirements Document (NFRD)**

- **Purpose**: Focuses on non-functional aspects, such as system performance, usability, and reliability.
- **Audience**: Developers, architects, and testers.
- **Key Components**:
  - Performance (e.g., response time, throughput)
  - Scalability and capacity planning
  - Security requirements
  - Accessibility standards

---

### **6. Test Plan/Strategy Document**

- **Purpose**: Outlines the testing approach, including types of tests and methodologies.
- **Audience**: QA teams, testers, and project managers.
- **Key Components**:
  - Types of tests (e.g., unit, integration, regression)
  - Test environments and tools
  - Test cases and criteria for success
  - Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

---

### **7. Design Document**

- **Purpose**: Provides a detailed design of the system or feature, often created after functional and technical requirements are established.
- **Audience**: Developers, designers, and system architects.
- **Key Components**:
  - High-level design (HLD) for architecture
  - Low-level design (LLD) for detailed components
  - Wireframes and prototypes (for UI/UX)
  - Class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc.

---

### **8. User Stories or Use Case Document**

- **Purpose**: Focuses on specific interactions between users and the system.
- **Audience**: Product owners, developers, and testers.
- **Key Components**:
  - User roles and goals
  - Steps in user interaction
  - Expected outcomes

---

### **9. Deployment Document**

- **Purpose**: Guides the deployment and release process for software.
- **Audience**: DevOps teams and system administrators.
- **Key Components**:
  - Deployment environments (e.g., staging, production)
  - Steps for deployment
  - Rollback procedures
  - Post-deployment checks

---

### **10. Maintenance and Support Document**

- **Purpose**: Details how the system will be supported after release.
- **Audience**: Support teams and system administrators.
- **Key Components**:
  - Maintenance schedules
  - Monitoring and logging details
  - Common issues and solutions
  - Contact points for escalations

---

### **11. Project Plan Document**

- **Purpose**: Covers the overall project scope, timeline, and resource allocation.
- **Audience**: Project managers and stakeholders.
- **Key Components**:
  - Project milestones and deliverables
  - Resource allocation
  - Risk management
  - Budget and timelines

---

### **12. Release Notes**

- **Purpose**: Summarizes changes, new features, and fixes in a release.
- **Audience**: End-users and internal teams.
- **Key Components**:
  - List of new features
  - Bug fixes
  - Known issues
  - Instructions for updating

The difference between `Start-Service -Name docker` and `Start-Service -Name com.docker.service` is due to how **Docker Desktop** is installed and how it manages the Docker Engine on Windows.

### Why `Start-Service -Name docker` Doesn't Work:

- The command `Start-Service -Name docker` is used to start the **Docker Engine** service directly on Linux or when Docker Engine is installed standalone on Windows (without Docker Desktop).
- In your case, **Docker Engine** is managed by **Docker Desktop**, so there's no separate `docker` service installed. That's why PowerShell cannot find a service named `docker` on your system—it simply doesn't exist.

### Why `Start-Service -Name com.docker.service` Works:

- **Docker Desktop** bundles the Docker Engine within the `com.docker.service`. When you start `com.docker.service`, it automatically starts the Docker Engine as part of Docker Desktop's services.
- So, on Windows, especially when you’re using Docker Desktop, the **Docker Engine** runs as part of the `com.docker.service`, not as a standalone `docker` service.

When you run:

```powershell
Start-Service -Name com.docker.service
```

It starts Docker Desktop in the background, which also starts Docker Engine, allowing you to use Docker commands from the CLI.

### Key Takeaway:

- On Windows with **Docker Desktop**, the Docker Engine is managed through the `com.docker.service`. If you want to start Docker without launching the Docker Desktop GUI, you can use `Start-Service -Name com.docker.service`.
- The `docker` service is typically only available in standalone Docker Engine installations on Linux or on Windows when using Docker without Docker Desktop.

If you want to avoid the Docker Desktop GUI but keep Docker Engine running, the solution is to use the `com.docker.service` service.

It looks like the **Docker Desktop Service** is installed but currently **stopped**. The Docker Engine itself might be tied to the Docker Desktop Service. Here’s how you can proceed:

### 1. **Start Docker Desktop Service**

Since the Docker service is currently stopped, you can try starting the Docker Desktop service to enable the Docker Engine without launching the full Docker Desktop interface.

Run the following PowerShell command to start the Docker Desktop service:

```powershell
Start-Service -Name com.docker.service
```

This should start the Docker Engine tied to Docker Desktop.

### 2. **Set Docker to Start Automatically**

You can configure Docker Desktop Service to start automatically when Windows starts up. To do this:

```powershell
Set-Service -Name com.docker.service -StartupType Automatic
```

This ensures that Docker Engine starts without needing Docker Desktop to be opened manually.

### 3. **Verify Docker is Running**

After starting the service, verify that Docker is working by running:

```powershell
docker version
```

If Docker Engine is running, this should return the client and server version information.

### 4. **Prevent Docker Desktop from Starting (Optional)**

If you don’t want the Docker Desktop GUI to start automatically, but you still want the Docker Engine running, you can disable Docker Desktop on startup:

- **Open Docker Desktop**.
- Navigate to **Settings** > **General**.
- Uncheck **Start Docker Desktop when you log in**.

### 5. **Using Docker from Command Line (Without GUI)**

Once the service is running, you should be able to use Docker from the command line without starting the Docker Desktop GUI.

Let me know if starting the service worked and if Docker is running properly!
